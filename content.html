            <h2>Forests</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A forest is defined as the area of land that is covered by trees. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations defined forest as “Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in this situation”. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use. <br><br> By using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 has concluded that the total forest lands cover about 4.06 million hectares or 10 million acres of land which sums up to 31% of the total land on the Earth’s surface in the year 2020. 
                    <br><br>Forests are important for the survival of all living beings. They are vital for our life as they provide oxygen, food, shelter, fuel, and means of livelihood for the tribal people living in and around the forest area. Forests are home to 80% of the global terrestrial biodiversity and are the source that fulfills all basic needs for adjacent human settlements. Everything from the oxygen we breathe to the wood used from fuel to use in construction comes from forests. It is a self-nourishing system, which is a host to a number of organisms. The ecosystem of every forest includes both biotic (living) and non-biotic components. The biotic components include plants, trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, mosses, algae, fungi, insects, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and microorganisms. </p>

            <h2>Oceans</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The Ocean is the foundation of all life, an extraordinary and largely unexplored place, teeming with fascinatingly diverse plants and animals which, together with currents and natural systems, shape our planet. The Ocean provides us with food and facilitates pleasure, as well as livelihoods for millions, if not billions of people.

                    But the Ocean is not just a commodity. The Ocean is restorative. It calms and connects us. The positive impact it can have on our wellbeing is immense.</p>
                    <p>From mermaids to the kraken, the Ocean has been fascinating humans for centuries. It is difficult to imagine what it must have been like to set off across the Ocean without knowing ‘what was on the other side’, or even if you might fall off of the world!

                        There a millions of works of art, poetry and fictional stories written about the sea, as well as religions and worship of the gods of the Ocean in communities across the world.</p>

            <h2>Mountains</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Overall, mountains are not only breathtaking natural features but also vital components of Earth’s ecosystems, water resources, climate systems, and cultural heritage. Protecting and conserving mountains is essential for maintaining the balance of our planet’s ecosystems and ensuring the well-being of both nature and human communities.
                    <br>Mountains are the ‘water towers’ of our planet, providing 60 to 80 percent of all freshwater resources. However, existing records show that glaciers in mountain ranges around the world are retreating and disappearing due to climate change. In recent years, at least 600 glaciers have completely disappeared, affecting the water resources of billions of people living downstream.
                    <br><br>Mountain destinations attract around 15-20 percent of global tourism and are areas of significant cultural diversity, knowledge, and heritage. While mountain tourism has the potential to promote economic development in remote and isolated areas, many mountain communities still do not benefit from it and live in poverty.
                    <br><br>Mountainous regions provide suitable high ground for renewable energy facilities, such as wind, hydroelectric, solar, and biomass. Hydroelectric power, often generated using moving water in mountainous areas, is one of the most prominent examples. Therefore, it is not surprising that many hydroelectric projects are located in mountainous regions.

                    Contrary to the common belief that mountains are not the best places for solar energy, research conducted in the  Swiss Alps shows that the sun can produce more energy in winter compared to summer. Many other countries that have solar energy installations in mountainous areas are also experiencing positive results.

            <h2>Deserts</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Deserts are one of the largest ecosystems in the world, covering one-fifth of the Earth and occupying every continent. A desert is classified as a place that receives less than 10 inches of rain per year. The dry environments have an evaporation rate that exceeds the overall amount of precipitation, which results in a more harsh climate for animals and plants. As time goes on, particular plants and animals have adapted to the warm temperatures that occur during the day and the significant drop that occurs at night. 
                    <br><br>Many think that desert conditions mean endless plains made of sand. When actually, they are composed of rocky plains or mountainous areas that will also have sand and various geological features. While the desert may seem like an intense and harsh environment, those who do adapt can live easily. The plants that live there absorb and store the water they do get. Almost every desert in the world differs from another due to the region and climate they’re surrounded by. They’re mostly classified as hot and dry, semiarid, coastal, and cold. 
                    <br><br>The deserts that host Lone Star Investments come from hot and dry deserts. Although they’re not as extreme as other deserts in this classification, they can get pretty hot and very cold during the night.
